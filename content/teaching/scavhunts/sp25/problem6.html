        <div class="problem">
            This year, Hello Kitty is spending time visiting her friends, My Melody, Kuromi, Cinnamoroll, Keroppi, and Pompompurin! She wants to make sure to spend an equal amount of time with each of her friends, so she goes between cities every 3 days, visiting each friend in the order listed above. This year, it’s Keroppi’s golden birthday - he is turning 10 on July 10. If Hello Kitty wants to start traveling in either January or February, on how many different days could she start her journey to make sure she gets to celebrate with him?        </div>
